This plugin is experimental, although it does minimally work.  To make it
usable on Ubuntu Touch when connected remotely (adb/ssh) you may need to
override PolicyKit's defaults:

  $ sudo cat /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-click.pkla
  [Allow installation of Click packages]
  Identity=unix-user:phablet
  Action=com.ubuntu.click.package-install;com.ubuntu.click.package-remove
  ResultAny=yes

(This is now installed in
/var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.click.pkla, for the
time being.)

Once that's done, install packagekit and packagekit-plugin-click, and you
should be able to do things like:

  $ pkcon -p install-local foo.click

I have not done any work on figuring out how to make this work on systems
with aptdaemon.  If you want to try this on a normal Ubuntu desktop system,
then for the time being I recommend creating an LXC container for the
purpose:

  $ sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n saucy-click -- -r saucy -a amd64 -b $USER
