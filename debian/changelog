  * If a user attempts to install a version of a package that is already
    installed in an underlay database, then just register the appropriate
    version for them rather than unpacking another copy.
  * Make "click hook run-system" and "click hook run-user" consistently use
    the bottom-most unpacked copy of a given version of a package, and
    update hook symlinks and user registration symlinks if necessary.

  * Give gir1.2-click-0.4 an exact-versioned dependency on libclick-0.4-0.
  * Use is_symlink helper method in a few more places.
  * Add a similar is_dir helper method.
  * Ignore extraneous non-directories when walking a database root in
    Click.DB.get_packages and Click.DB.gc.
  * Make the PackageKit plugin tolerate the "_removable" dynamic manifest
    key being changed to a boolean in the future.
  * Document that users of "_removable" should tolerate it being a boolean.
  * Use libclick when removing packages, listing packages, or searching
    packages via the PackageKit plugin.
  * Add libclick interfaces to get package manifests, both individually
    (LP: #1287692) and for all installed packages (LP: #1287693).
  * Override description-starts-with-package-name Lintian error for click;
    this is describing the system as a whole rather than naming the package.
  * Add libclick interfaces to get the list of frameworks supported by the
    current system (LP: #1271633) and various properties of those frameworks
    (LP: #1287694).

  * gobject-introspection-1.0.pc is in libgirepository1.0-dev, not
    gobject-introspection.  Fix Build-Depends.
  * Build-depend and depend on gir1.2-glib-2.0 and python3-gi.
  * Map gboolean to ctypes.c_int, not ctypes.c_bool.  gboolean and gint are
    the same as far as glib is concerned, and ctypes does strange things
    with its bool type in callbacks.

  * Use full path to click in Upstart jobs to save a $PATH lookup.
  * Add systemd units to run Click system and user hooks at the appropriate
    times.  We probably won't be using these for a while, but it does no
    harm to add them.
  * Move an initial core of functionality (database, hooks, osextras, query,
    user) from Python into a new "libclick" library, allowing
    performance-critical clients to avoid the cost of starting a new Python
    interpreter (LP: #1282311).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * hooks: Fix expansion of "$$" in hook patterns to conform to the
    documented behaviour of expanding to the single character "$".
  * Move version detection out of configure.ac into a separate get-version
    script, since intltool-update has trouble with the previous approach.
  * Stop using unittest2 if available; the relevant improvements were
    integrated into the standard library's unittest in Python 2.7, and we no
    longer support 2.6.
  * user: When setting the registered version of a package to the version in
    an underlay database (e.g. a preinstalled version vs. one in the
    user-installed area), remove the overlay link rather than setting a new
    one equal to the underlay; this was always the intended behaviour but
    didn't work that way due to a typo.
  * Add Python 3.4 to list of tested versions.
  * Call setup.py from the top-level Makefile.am rather than from
    debian/rules, to make the build system a bit more unified.
  * Drop AM_GNU_GETTEXT and call intltoolize before autoreconf in
    autogen.sh; this fixes a bug whereby "make" after "./configure" always
    immediately needed to run aclocal.
  * Build-depend on python3-pep8 so that test_pep8_clean doesn't need to be
    skipped when running under Python 3.  This can safely be removed for
    backports to precise.
  * Simplify click -> python3-click dependency given that both are
    Architecture: any.
  * Tighten packagekit-plugin-click -> click dependency to require a
    matching version.
  * Use dh_install --fail-missing to avoid future mistakes.
  * Sync up substvar use with what debhelper actually generates for us: add
    ${misc:Pre-Depends} to click and packagekit-plugin-click, and remove
    ${python3:Depends} from click-dev.
  * Reset SIGPIPE handling from Python's default of raising an exception to
    the Unix default of terminating the process (LP: #1285790).

  * chroot: Print help if no subcommand given (LP: #1260669).
  * chroot: Recommend debootstrap from click-dev, and explicitly check for
    it in "click chroot create" (LP: #1260487).
  * chroot: Check for root in "create" and "destroy" (LP: #1260671).
  * hooks: Add a ${short-id} expansion to hook patterns; this is valid only
    in user-level or single-version hooks, and expands to a new "short
    application ID" without the version (LP: #1251635).
  * hooks: Strip any trailing slashes from the end of patterns, as they
    cause confusion with symlink-to-directory semantics and can never be
    useful (LP: #1253855).
  * install: Extend the interpretation of "framework" a little bit to allow
    a Click package to declare that it requires multiple frameworks.  This
    will allow splitting up the SDK framework declarations into more
    fine-grained elements.
  * Policy version 3.9.5: no changes required.
  * build: Enforce only a single framework declaration for now, by request.

  [ Zoltan Balogh ]
  * Add qtmultimedia5-dev to the SDK framework list.

click (0.4.9) saucy; urgency=low

  * Explicitly build-depend on pkg-config, since it's needed even if the
    PackageKit/GLib-related build-dependencies are removed for backporting.
  * Remove some stray documentation references to Ubuntu 13.04.
  * Ensure that the user's overlay database directory exists when
    unregistering a preinstalled package (LP: #1232066).
  * Support packages containing code for multiple architectures, and
    document the "architecture" manifest field (LP: #1214380, #1214864).
  * Correctly pass through return values of commands as the exit status of
    the "click" wrapper.
  * Extend "click info" to take a registered package name as an alternative
    to a path to a Click package file (LP: #1232118).

click (0.4.8) saucy; urgency=low

  * Show a proper error message if "click build" or "click buildsource" is
    called on a directory that does not exist or does not contain a manifest
    file, rather than crashing (LP: #1228619).
  * Restore missing newlines after JSON dumps in "click info" and "click
    list --manifest".
  * Tidy up use of PackageKit IDs; local:click should refer to uninstalled
    packages, while installed:click refers to installed packages.
  * Expose application names and whether a package is removable via the
    PackageKit API: the IDs of installed applications are now formed as
    comma-separated key/value pairs, e.g.
    "installed:click,removable=1,app_name=foo,app_name=bar" (LP: #1209329).
  * Rename ClickUser.__setitem__ to ClickUser.set_version and
    ClickUser.__delitem__ to ClickUser.remove; with multiple databases it
    was impossible for these methods to fulfil the normal contract for
    mutable mappings, since deleting an item might simply expose an item in
    an underlying database.
  * Allow unregistering preinstalled packages.  A preinstalled package
    cannot in general actually be removed from disk, but unregistering it
    for a user records it as being hidden from that user's list of
    registered packages.  Reinstalling the same version unhides it.
  * Consolidate ClickInstaller.audit_control into ClickInstaller.audit.
  * Validate the shipped md5sums file in "click verify" (LP: #1217333).

  * Run system hooks when removing a package from the file system

  * If a hook symlink is already correct, don't unnecessarily remove and
    recreate it.
  * Improve "click hook install-system" and "click hook install-user" to
    remove any stale symlinks they find, and to run Exec commands only once
    per hook.  This significantly speeds up system and session startup when
    lots of applications are installed (LP: #1227604).
  * Rename "click hook install-system" and "click hook install-user" to
    "click hook run-system" and "click hook run-user" respectively, to
    better fit their semantics.  (I expect these commands only to have been
    used internally by click's own Upstart jobs.)

  * Add a click(1) manual page.
  * Use json.dump and json.load in most places rather than json.dumps and
    json.loads (which unnecessarily construct strings).
  * Add "click unregister", which unregisters a package for a user and
    removes it from disk if it is not being used.
  * Add RemovePackage support to the PackageKit plugin, mapped to "click
    unregister".
  * Attempt to remove the old version of a package after installing or
    registering a new one.
  * Remove code supporting PackageKit 0.7 API, and instead arrange to
    disable the PackageKit plugin if the new API is not available, since we
    don't need to build it on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
  * Report errors from click subprocesses in PackageKit plugin

  * Add the dynamic key "_directory" to "click list --manifest" output,
    showing the directory where each package is unpacked (LP: #1221760).
  * Add the dynamic key "_removable" to "click list --manifest" output,
    which is 1 if a package is unpacked in a location from which it can be

  * Add support for multiple installation root directories, configured in

  * Add --all-users option to "click install" and "click register": this
    registers the installed package for a special pseudo-user "@all", making
    it visible to all users.
  * Add "click hook install-user", which runs all user-level hooks for all

click (0.1.5) saucy; urgency=low

  * Fix infinite recursion in ClickUser.click_pw.
  * When all the files requested for installation are Click packages,
    override org.freedesktop.packagekit.package-install* PolicyKit actions
    to com.ubuntu.click.package-install, defined with a more open default
    policy.  (This requires some backports to PackageKit, not in the archive
    yet.)
