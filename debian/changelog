click (0.2.1) saucy; urgency=low

  * Fix "click help list".
  * Remove HOME from environment when running dpkg, so that it doesn't try
    to read .dpkg.cfg from it (which may fail when dropping privileges from
    root and produce a warning message).
  * Refuse to install .click directories at any level, not just the top.
  * Add "click pkgdir" command to print the top-level package directory from
    either a package name or a path within a package; based on work by Ted
    Gould, for which thanks.

click (0.2.0) saucy; urgency=low

  * Revise and implement hooks specification.  While many things have
    changed, the previous version was never fully implemented.  However, I
    have incremented the default Click-Version value to 0.2 to reflect the
    design work.
    - The "hooks" manifest key now contains a dictionary keyed by
      application name.  This means manifest authors have to repeat
      themselves much less in common cases.
    - There is now an explicit distinction between system-level and
      user-level hooks.  System-level hooks may reflect multiple concurrent
      versions, and require a user name.
    - Hook symlinks are now named by a combination of the Click package
      name, the application name, and the Click package version.
    - The syntax of Pattern has changed to make it easier to extend with new
      substitutions.
  * Reject '_' and '/' characters in all of package name, application name,
    and package version.

click (0.1.7) saucy; urgency=low

  * Correct name of .pkla file (now
    /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.click.pkla).

click (0.1.6) saucy; urgency=low

  * Move defaults for frameworks and hooks directories to click.paths.
  * Install /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/10-click.pkla to
    allow the phablet user to install Click packages without being known to
    logind, as a temporary workaround.

click (0.1.5) saucy; urgency=low

  * Fix infinite recursion in ClickUser.click_pw.
  * When all the files requested for installation are Click packages,
    override org.freedesktop.packagekit.package-install* PolicyKit actions
    to com.ubuntu.click.package-install, defined with a more open default
    policy.  (This requires some backports to PackageKit, not in the archive
    yet.)

  * Add an autotools-based build system for our C components.
  * Initial version of a PackageKit plugin, in a new packagekit-plugin-click
    package; still experimental.
  * Restore compatibility with Python 3.2 (LP: #1200670).
  * Adjust tests to pass with mock 0.7.2 (as in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).
  * Make the default root directory a configure option.
  * Add a simple "click list" command.
